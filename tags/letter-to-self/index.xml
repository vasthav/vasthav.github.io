      <description>Dear Vasthav,
Trust me I know exactly how you feel. With just a few more days to go for your board exams, you have already started to feel the heat. You have stopped enjoying the process. And the thoughts of moving to Kerala after 10th feels like pulling yourself out of the mud with your roots and identity still firmly holding to Nasik.</description>
