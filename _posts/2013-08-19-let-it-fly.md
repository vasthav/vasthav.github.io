Things that i am not having today but will one day…

Everyone of us is will definitely have some small dreams in their hearts that keep them going. Everyone of us might be having small dreams that gives them enough strength to fight with the troubles of today for the surprises and gifts of tomorrow. This may be a thing, a place, a special journey, becoming something, owning something or even being with a person that they cherished for a lifetime.

This things may not be seeming to be ever going to occur ever in near distant future but that’s the thrill in it. That’s  what God has made it to be. Then only we mankind will keep on moving and achieving our goals against all odds.
